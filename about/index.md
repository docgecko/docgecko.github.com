## Who am I?

Over the last 20 years I have operated at a management, commercial and technical advisor at strategic, board and senior management levels.  I have consulted on tenders, advised business consortia and government bodies, developed and implemented risk management strategies, optimized business and asset performance management and most notably developed and implemented performance- and risk-based expert business intelligence systems within tender and post-tender Public Private Partnership (PPP) and Private Finance Intiative (PFI) deals.

I also hold a PhD in Risk Management from [Cranfield University](http://www.cranfield.ac.uk/doctoral/subject/engineering/page44849.html) and I am considered a versatile partner who thrives on challenges and who has a talent for proactively identifying and providing manageable and sustainable solutions.
