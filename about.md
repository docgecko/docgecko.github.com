This site contains a selection of articles written by Dr Daren Warburton, based primarily on works related creating risk-based asset performance models.

With over 20 years experience as a management, commercial and technical advisor, I have operated at strategic, board and senior management levels. I've consulted on tenders and with business consortia and government bodies, developed and implemented risk management strategies, optimized business and asset performance management and most notably developed and implemented performance- and risk-based Expert Business Intelligence systems within tender and post-tender PPP and PFI deals.

I hold a PhD in Risk Management from [Cranfield University](http://www.cranfield.ac.uk/doctoral/subject/engineering/page44849.html) and am considered a versatile partner who thrives on challenges and have a talent for proactively identifying and providing manageable and sustainable solutions.
